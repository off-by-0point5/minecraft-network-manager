### Servermanager

This repo is thrown together by someone who does not know anything about code quality or development strategies.

I simply try to build something that suits my needs for a private network.

With these plugins for proxy (BungeeCord, Velocity) and backend server (Paper, Spigot is unsupported, Minestom) should be able to automatically register and unregister backend servers as they start and stop. So there is no need to configure the whole network in the proxy config.

The current version got a (really bulky) feature of a server menu.

### ToDo
- [ ] Make a better API for more possible server switching methods
- [ ] Commands for joining server groups and servers
- [ ] Commands for listing server groups and servers
- [ ] Write better code
